We do hope to offer them soon, though! For the time being, we are only able to fill our glasses with either distance or reading lenses. However, we do have a frame-only purchase option for $85.50 (which is 10% off the standard $95 price) for customers who prefer to purchase the frames and bring them to a local optical shop to have the lenses of their choice inserted.

Now, for some good news: by checking out the overall width and specific measurements for each frame, you may be able to find a smaller frame that works.

Feel free to sign up for our email updates so you'll be among the first to know once they're available. For the time being, we can make single vision lenses for either distance or reading. We also offer a frame-only purchase option for our customers who prefer to have their lenses filled locally. Simply choose "non-prescription" during checkout, and from there the option that indicates you'll be having your lenses filled locally, at which point a 10% discount will be added to the frames for you!

Thank you so much for your interest in Warby Parker! First, the bad news: we do not currently offer transition lenses. Now, some good news: if you've found a Warby Parker frame that you love and would like to have transition lenses inserted, we offer a frame-only purchase option at a 10% discount. You can buy frames (at 10% off) and take them to your local optical shop, where they will insert the lenses of your choice.

If you're looking for something a little softer on across the top of the frame, we'd suggest taking a look at the Marshall (http://warby.me/156pwIo) or Ainsworth (http://warby.me/XuOOLw) frames. They are similar in general shape to the Roosevelt and Bensen, but we think you may prefer their shape across the top. Let us know if you need any other help with suggestions! 0;{};}

All of the acetate we use for our frames is mixed by hand so there can be some variation in the coloring, but overall the Blue Marblewood is a gorgeous color.

The Nevilles in Blue Marblewood were actually part of our limited Hayworth collection so we don't have any plans to make them available again.

Let us explain! Before we launched our Canadian website, we shipped to Canada from our original US site.  All of our frames were $95 USD—however, there was also a $35 USD shipping cost, so the total wound up to be $130 USD.  

When we launched our Canadian website, we transferred all prices over to CAD, to make the process as simple as possible. In doing so, we created a flat-rate shipping cost of $10 CAD, which includes all shipping, handling, customs and tariffs.When you add the reduced shipping cost, the price winds up exactly the same as it used to be! The overall goal was to make things as easy as possible for our wonderful neighbors up north! {};}

I took the bait from Coastal.com and got a pair of free frames from them, shortly after I received my first pair of Warby Parkers.

The bottom line is that I'll be getting some new frames in a couple of weeks, and those will be coming from Warby Parker. {};Carl Black [551535018] I'm presuming this is about a certain other company on a certain deal site today. I actually heard of them first, so I'm not sure who really was first, but clearly one company has set the cool mark pretty high. Like Thomas, I got the initial free pair from Coastal.com and then purchased a "deal" to get another pair from them. Only, the deal wouldn't apply to any of their promos, and everything there is a promo. So, I ended up losing the whole deal, as LivingSocial wouldn't give me a refund.

I will take steps to make their 'logistics' work for me when it comes to my orders from your company, but I hope that in the future you will consider other carriers. 0;{};}

You should compare their frames to a high quality frame and you will see. 0;{};Lyndi Fandino Schmidt [1231971183] This is true.  Warby Parker manufactures glasses out of the same China factory as LensCrafters, just with their brand name stamped on it (inside source closely connected to founders).  My opticians have tried to adjust these uncomfortable frames for people who bought them.  They are so poorly constructed that no amount of adjustment can be done to make them more comfortable. 0;{};Warby Parker [308998183837] We're sorry you feel that way, Philip and Lyndi. If you are having trouble with any of our frames, we would be happy to fix any issues. Just message us!

Learn more about how we make our glasses here: http://warby.me/143daQm 0;{};Tricia Hudspeth [58212610] I worked for a well-known optical lab for 2 years and despite my employee discount, I still purchased my glasses from Warby Parker.

While some local shops provide this service for free, others may charge a small fee to adjust frames that were not purchased in-store. If you end up paying to have your Warby Parkers adjusted, just save the receipt and send it our way – we’ll reimburse you for the full cost! You can snap a phone photo of your receipt (or scan it) and email to help@warbyparker.com. You can also fax it to us at 877-277-6340.

All Warby Parker frames are made of high-quality cellulose acetate sourced from a 150-year-old family-owned Italian manufacturer. The frames and their components are crafted in China at factories that our founders and staff regularly visit to ensure both the integrity of the manufacturing process and the quality of the working conditions. 

After the frames are completed in China, they are shipped to our lab right here in the US, where we custom-cut prescription lenses and ship them off to customers. All of our greenhouse gas emissions are carefully mapped, and we purchase carbon offsets accordingly.

Let us know if you have any other questions! 0;{};}

Most local optical shops are able to make these adjustments, though it is worth calling ahead to be sure. 

While some local shops provide this service for free, others may charge a small fee to adjust frames that were not purchased in-store. If you end up paying to have your Warby Parkers adjusted, just save the receipt and send it our way – we’ll reimburse you for the full cost! You can snap a phone photo of your receipt (or scan it) and email to help@warbyparker.com. You can also fax it to us at 877-277-6340. 

Please let us know how you would like to proceed with your order. You can send us a message!

Option #3: We can send you a pair of frames with replaceable demo lenses at a 10% discount. You can take these frames to your local optical shop and they will replace the demo lenses with your prescription lenses.

We'll definitely let everyone know once we are able to fill progressive prescriptions. Also, if you are having trouble ordering the frame you want for a Home Try-On order, give us a call at 888-492-7297 M-F 9 am - 9 pm and we'd be happy to double check our inventory for you! 0;{};}

Unfortunately, at the moment, we're not able to provide bifocal lenses in our glasses. We are planning to launch progressives (no-line bifocals) within the next few months, though, so stay tuned!

All of our optical lenses do come with anti-scratch, anti-reflective and UV coatings free of charge! However, we're unfortunately not able to provide transition lenses for our glasses. If you prefer to have these types of lenses, we do offer a frame-only purchase for our customers - you're welcome to purchase your perfect pair of Warby Parkers and have a local optician fill your lenses with these coatings.

Unfortunately, we aren't able to offer safety glasses either. I'm so sorry to disappoint! If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch. We hope to get you into a great new pair of Warby Parkers soon! {};}

Luxottica, for example, controls the entire process from manufacture straight through to dispensing. Where is the middle man? Do you not see how that premise could be inferred to target small business owners that perform a valuable service to society? What do you recommend your customers do when they need an adjustment to their generically bench aligned glasses received in the mail?

Get your specs direct from China. {};Glaswerk Optical [1328403844] So you claim that if an optician charges to take a pupillary distance, you will refund your customer that cost. And when the glasses press in against the sides of someone's head or slide down his/her nose and they need to be "custom fitted" what then? I think you are severely de-valuing the need for a brick and mortar location for these needs to be addressed. You claim to be better than the large corporations for the eye care of consumers.

Most local optical shops are able to make these adjustments, though it is worth calling ahead to be sure. 
While some local shops provide this service for free, others may charge a small fee to adjust frames that were not purchased in-store. If you end up paying to have your Warby Parkers adjusted, just save the receipt and send it our way – we’ll reimburse you for the full cost! You can snap a phone photo of your receipt (or scan it) and email to help@warbyparker.com. You can also fax it to us at 877-277-6340. 

One tip: if you decide to have your frames adjusted, be sure to tell the technician to use low heat and light pressure on your glasses, especially if you have high index lenses. Too much heat can cause bubbles, cloudiness, or even cracks to appear. Yikes. 0;{};Zarpana Kabir [776285716] Thank you WP! I'll try calling around :) 0;{};}

So I welcome this 0;{};Kevin Reynolds [620113080] It is becoming closer to a monopoly, so any competition is great 0;{};Susan Brannigan [667015973] That was a very informative commercial for Warby Parker. ;) #hazardsofmarketplacereporting 0;{};Torr Leonard [1310731580] Similar to LOOKMATIC 0;{};Jonathan Tsang [1203772] I got a pair last week. pretty happy so far 0;{};Javi Max Ruiz Castillejos [805618825] I own three pairs. They're nice and together still cost less then previous pair of glasses. 0;{};Erin Molnar [2255639] My husband got a pair but the lenses don't seem great quality and the fit is hard to order online. I'm up for new glasses again and don't think I'll get them from WP 0;{};Roberta Sheronas Perry [506323993] Yes, our eyes are WP fans. Love the concept. 0;{};Roland H Pesch [1613504981] Sounds good, but I don't see how I could possibly get decent service without the hands-on help of my optician (not a chain).  I wear progressive lenses, and I read a lot; the optician makes sure to order extra-wide reading area (the default seems to assume one spends as little time as possible) and then makes sure the positioning is exactly right.  This often involves tweaking all sorts of components of the glasses to fit my nose and cheekbones.  How can this possibly happen online? {};Carlos Armando Castro [5030043] I'm a huge fan of Warby Parker Eyewear. Their customer service is top notch and incredibly friendly that goes out of their way for you. Also they are trying to do some good in the world with every Eyewear purchase and they have really great frame styles. I recommended them  to many of my friends. {};Larry Port [1064451484] I bought two pairs last year! I have to say, in my own humble opinion, I look awesome in them. 0;{};Kyle Fletcher Baker [100003354230054] Never heard of them...probably will never use them...have three frames and all set for life 0;{};Heath Roberts [1636926888] I asked my ophthalmologist to measure my pupil distance--you need this to order glasses online. He wondered why I wanted it, I explained that I thought glasses are a racket. He thought the prescription he had written me should cost about $75 plus frames at the optician he recommended. They wanted over $300 (plus frames). That would have been more than three times his fee. So the doctor had no idea what glasses cost... I ended up buying a pair from Costco for &140.

I've heard of Warby Parker but not tried them. I stand by the opinion that glasses are mostly a racket and I'm happy they're providing some competition. 0;{};Jonathan Goldsmith Cohen [100000611351742] I have some very swanky handmade frames from Eyedesign and don't wear contacts. An analogy to coffee is apt. Would you rather drink it from styrofoam or bone china? At the higher end of the market, people like me will still want top quality frames. At the Pearle Vision end of things I think the Warby Parker business model will ultimately dominate. 0;{};Nancy Johnson [1230753230] I am indeed a fan--of the idea, just not of the frames, since they all look quite similar and are quite unflattering for many of us. 0;{};Eric Wheeling [100000423953617] Essilor owns Luxottica. Someone pointed this out. Somewhat relevant:

The guy in ChessBoxer wears Warby-Parkers.  :) 0;{};Robin Stambaugh Brandt [1508420662] I've had my first Warby Parker's for about two months.  Everything about the buying experience was great, and the quality is excellent. 0;{};Frank Forkl [24408212] zennioptical.com does the same thing with less pretentiousness and even lower prices. They get my money. 0;{};Ichiro Sugioka [728760852] We will give them a try. 0;{};Katie Vojtko [14213066] I've used them for years. Very happy with my glasses and the service. 0;{};Linda Chenoweth Harlow [1660838026] I'll continue to use my local not a chain eye doctor.  I wear bifocals, have astigmatism, some near sightedness and my left eye is far worse than my right. In addition I have high cheekbones and not all frames fit me. I need hands on fitting and exams and even then my lenses need tweaking. 0;{};Hollisd Paul [1715964227] Cataract surgery and the use of a Toric lenses reduced my extreme astigmatism (legally blind with out lenses and moving off the chart for the cheap providers) brought my vision back to 20/20 in the left eye and 20/30 in the right eye.  I can drive without glasses!  But I need a prescription for reading (residual astigmatism in right eye) and am thinking of getting a pair with a reading bifocal and plano for distance vision.  This looks like the place to go.  Unfortunately, as reported on the MarketPlace website,they do not do bifocals.  Sigh! 0;{};Amy Lee [605489144] It's about time to have some real competition in this business! So many people in the U.S. don't have eye insurance and for those who do, the benefits are often not enough to pay for even the frames! {};}

While some local shops will provide an adjustment service for free, others may charge a small fee if the glasses were not purchased in-store. If you end up paying to have your Warby Parkers adjusted, just save the receipt and send it our way – we’ll reimburse you for the full cost! You can snap a phone photo of your receipt (or scan it) and email to help@warbyparker.com. You can also fax it to us at 877-277-6340. 

One tip: if you decide to have your frames adjusted, be sure to tell the technician to use low heat and light pressure on your glasses, especially if you have high index lenses. Too much heat can cause bubbles, cloudiness, or even cracks to appear. Yikes. {};Jen Hoffman [534327931] Thank you so much for the quick response! Merry Christmas to you guys! :) 0;{};}

A professional adjustment should do the trick! Most local optical shops are able to make these adjustments, though it is worth calling ahead to be sure. While some local shops provide this service for free, others may charge a small fee to adjust frames that were not purchased in-store. If you end up paying to have your Warby Parkers adjusted, just save the receipt and send it our way – we’ll reimburse you for the full cost! One tip: if you decide to have your frames adjusted, be sure to tell the technician to use low heat and light pressure on your glasses, especially if you have high index lenses. Too much heat can cause bubbles, cloudiness, or even cracks to appear. Let us know if you need anything else. We'd be glad to help! 0;{};Tess McBride [11515667] You guys rock... seriously rock.

To be quite honest, we like all three styles on you. Both the Ainsworth and the Miles fit great and go with well with your face shape and complexion. If we had to choose one pair, we'd have to go with the Ainsworth! It's such a great frame and the Walnut Tortoise works so well on you! These are the winners in our opinion! {};Gail Thomas Clark [1244194600] It's my favorite too!  Many of my friends prefer the Miles, but I think it's just because it's a little less bold and not quite such a departure.  But I'm ready for something new and fun that expresses me, since I wear my glasses pretty much constantly.  I have another HTO box coming, so I'll be posting a few more pics if I find any in the next goody box that I love!  This is the best marketing idea ever!! 0;{};Warby Parker [308998183837] We're looking forward to seeing the other pictures. We got to admit though, it's going to be pretty tough changing our minds about the Ainsworth! 0;{};Gail Thomas Clark [1244194600] I agree. But since I can try so many, this way I will know for sure.

Things just work better from the computer than the phone I guess.  I'd love some expert WP feedback.  I loved the other three frames as well but I have a pretty strong prescription, multifocal, and thick lenses, so my eye doctor said I can't go too large with the frames and the others (Sinclair and Preston) were too big and the Webb was almost just like the Miles but I like the Miles better. 0;{};Warby Parker [308998183837] We suggest looking into the Finn (http://warby.me/PPGcMO), Zagg (http://warby.me/RPhWdu), Reece  (http://warby.me/RxExdd), Quincy (http://warby.me/SHE3zR) and Marlowe (http://warby.me/Xyr0qB). These frames are all very similar to both the Miles and the Webb. We think these all look great and aren't too large so your doctor should be able to fill your prescription just fine. Let us know if you have any other questions! 0;{};Gail Thomas Clark [1244194600] I have tried several of those already, but my husband prefers the rounder frames and these are pretty much all rectangular.  I posted a pic of me in the Ainsworth Walnut Tortoise which I love and am hoping it's not too large.  I also posted a pic of me in the Miles, which has rounded corners at the bottom.  Just want some feedback between those two, and then I have another box coming with a few more options. 0;{};}

The frames are crafted in China at factories that our founders and staff regularly visit to ensure both the integrity of the manufacturing process and the quality of the working conditions. Then they are shipped to our lab right here in the US, where we assemble the frame's components and custom-cut prescription lenses before shipping them off to customers. You can learn more about how our glasses are made on our website at http://warby.me/Xl8K47. {};Kurt Taylor [1087415861] Thanks for clearing that up.

If you purchase a pair and you don't like them, you can always exchange them for a different pair. There is a $20 CAD restocking fee but the exchange pair is shipped to you for free. If you have any questions, please let us know! 0;{};Noelle Elia [859590386] sadly, all the ones i seem to like are not available for virtual try on....and i was hoping to do try-on-5-thru' the mail, but that also seems not possible. :( 0;{};}

Eye insurance sucks, and WP seems to provide a real alternative to the price gouging within the glasses and sunglasses industry. 0;{};Bob Faktor [1429712749] Then you haven't gone to an optician.  You have gone to an untrained sales person.  That is exactly what Warby Parker is.  Treating medical devices as a commodity.  Find a private optical shop, not a chain store in the mall and try it once.  You will be amazed at the difference. {};Bob Faktor [1429712749] Just a few of the measurements I take for every patient:  monocular pupilary distance, optical center height, pantoscopic tilt, vertex distance, and dihedral angle.  Then I adjust the temples, temple tips, nose pads, and any other part of the frame necessary for a proper, individualized fit to each and every patient.  The fitting process can take up to 30 minutes or longer, not including choosing a frame and selecting the best lens material and options for each patient depending upon Rx and lifestyle needs. 0;{};Mary Crapo-Pereira [100000139915209] I have never been to an optician that took 30 mins of measurement including the opticians located at the optical shop at a Mass Eye and Ear! 0;{};Andrea Jones Blackford [1420693281] Funny, he's avoiding the price gouging issue.  I do work with private optical shop that has had not problems with my W-Ps, as long as I bring them in so he can check them out. So I'm not only helping someone get a free pair of glasses, I'm also helping out a local, non chain business.  Which, I might add, my crappy EyeMed insurance doesn't pay for. So if I have to pay out of pocket, it's good to have an alternative.  As for treating medical devices as a commodity, please tell Aetna they are doing that, because they don't offer me an alternative. {};Bob Faktor [1429712749] Oh, yeah. Price gouging. Warby Parker sells frames and lenses for $95; they pay $1.60 for the frame from china and around $2.00 for the polycarbonate lenses. That's around 2600% markup.  My average markup is   2.5 - 3x and this has to cover  the expenses of operating a retail storefront. 

That pretty much covers price gouging. 0;{};Andrea Jones Blackford [1420693281] As I mentioned previously, I've seen plenty of "made in China" in the shops that are covered by my EyeMed policy. Specialty shops have quoted me more than $450 for glasses. I went to a specialty, non-chain shop that sold me progressives for $400 that gave me a headache, frames that constantly needed adjustment, I couldn't wear them...at all.  And to be frank, no one seems to have the styles I want...everyone wants to stick me in ugly old-lady frames that I abhor.  Give me the styles that I want, good customer service, and prices that don't require me to fork over one-quarter of my mortgage payment.  That's all. So working with my eye doctor, optician, and WP is working for me right now. 0;{};Mary Crapo-Pereira [100000139915209] It seems as though you are not really here to warn people about the quality of eye care but more that you are bothered by WP having a quality frame at a reasonable price.  The lenses are exceptional according to my eye doctor and they are trendy.  Some people may like the more intimate service of a private optical shop but others do not.  If WP is not taking away your business as you previously stated, what is the problem? {};Andrea Jones Blackford [1420693281] That is a good question. 0;{};}

Our frames are made of high-quality cellulose acetate sourced from a 150-year-old family-owned Italian manufacturer.

Our founders have visited each of the factories we work with to ensure both the integrity of the manufacturing process and the quality of the working conditions. The completed frames are then shipped to our lab here in the US, where we custom-cut your prescription lenses and ship them off to you. Please let us know if you have any additional questions! 0;{};}

I agree that the Zagg frames look better, but the fit is a little snug and both the Thompson and Japhy frames with their 145mm temple sizes are a slightly more comfortable fit than the Zaggs with a 140mm temple size. Can the Zaggs be adjusted so that I'm happy with them? 0;{};Rot Job [829832887] Zagg all the way, but they can't be adjusted.  I had the same problem with another model.  I'd go with Japhy if they are more comfortable. 0;{};Warby Parker [308998183837] Hey Fred! Loving those Zaggs on you. In answer to your question they can be adjusted so that they fit a little better. If you are in New York we can adjust them for you here in our showroom. If not, they can be adjusted at any local optical shop using low heat and light pressure. Also, if you purchase a pair and can't get them adjusted to a comfortable place, we would be happy to set up a return for you. Hope this helps! 0;{};Fred Kendrick [1463920719] Thanks, I will be in NY in the next month or two. I would rather not have to order a pair and return them, so I will stop by the showroom. 0;{};}

From how you've described it, we think that you'd look great in the Sandalwood Matte, Striped Chestnut or Whiskey Tortoise! Also, the Hazelwood is not available for Home Try-On but it could be a good option for you too. The color is essentially the same as the Sandalwood but it has a glossy finish rather than matte! 0;{};Valerie Rausch Spagnuolo [1801862] I have medium/dark blonde hair & hazel eyes and I just put my order in for Sandalwood Matte.

Sorry, our Tennessee Whiskey frames are a dark tortoise on top with a clear bottom. We don't currently make any frames like this with black/clear—the closest we have is the Lunar Fade, which fades from black to clear, and that's available in the Winston only.
